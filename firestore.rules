/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the educational institution app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model, primarily leveraging the existence
 * of documents in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection to grant admin privileges. Data is
 * generally open for reading but restricted for modifications, with admin users having write
 * access. This design prioritizes ease of use for data retrieval while maintaining strong
 * control over data integrity.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/students/{studentId}`: Stores student information.
 * - `/teachers/{teacherId}`: Stores teacher information.
 * - `/course_details/{courseDetailsId}`: Stores course details.
 * - `/regularity/{regularityId}`: Stores student regularity statuses; preceptors can update these.
 * - `/course_assignments/{courseAssignmentId}`: Stores teacher-course assignments.
 * - `/grades/{gradeId}`: Stores student grades.
 * - `/roles_admin/{userId}`: Indicates admin status; the existence of a document with a userId grants admin rights.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All collections are readable by anyone (signed in or not).
 * - Write access is generally restricted to admins.
 * - The existence of a document under `/roles_admin/{userId}` is the sole indicator of admin status.
 * - Data validation is relaxed to facilitate rapid prototyping. However, relational integrity is enforced
 *   where applicable (e.g., ensuring the `studentId` in a `/grades/{gradeId}` document matches the
 *   `studentId` parameter in the path).
